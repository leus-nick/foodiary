## About

This app is like a food diary. In the beginning, you determine your maximum calorie intake. Then you can create menu cards for the day, but the app won't let you make a card that exceeds your calorie limit.

The application allows you to create an account in which all your cards will be stored. There are options to edit your calorie limit, add and delete cards, add and delete meals to a card, and view advanced meal information.

React was used for the frontend part of the application. The application is also serverless, because Firebase was used.
